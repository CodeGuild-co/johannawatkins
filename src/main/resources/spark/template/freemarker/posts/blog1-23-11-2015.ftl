<h1><u> Arrival at Villiers Park - 23/11/2015</h1></u>
<p>Villiers Park is a place that is highly talked about at my school; it’s all the Head of Sixth Form goes on about. Year 13 students come back from the courses sharing their incredible experiences and recommending courses to younger pupils. I’m not the highest achiever in my Computing class, but when the opportunity rose for Villiers Park, I certainly wasn’t going to ignore it.</p>
<p>Villiers Park, for me, is a great place to gain more university experience and a better insight into a Computer Science course. Through sample lectures and group project work, I’m learning vital skills from communication skills, to written schools (writing this blog post!)</p>
<p>I think the biggest challenge for me is going to be coping with the demands of the course. Pretty much everyone except for me is predicted AAA or higher in their A-Levels, whereas I’m predicted BBD. In all fairness, my Computing teacher did say on the form I’m capable of an A or A*, so surely that is a positive sign!</p>
<p>After my 3 hour car journey, I arrived today only knowing one person and she hadn’t arrived yet, so I felt a little lonely on my own in my bedroom. I was told about a games room and common room area, but I didn’t have the guts to socialise with potentially a room full of the male gender. However after 45 minutes, my friend finally turned up and we checked out the place together. </p>
<p>It’s currently 16:14 on the 23rd November 2015 as I write this and all I hear is the sound of finger frantically typing their first blog post, like me.  I imagine everyone is talking about the lunch buffet, how they aced the game of table tennis against their roommate, or how annoying another guy is on this course. Currently, I’m the only girl in this room of 15 students, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. But as I sit on the end of the row, I feel quite out of place. It’s like a bowl of grapes, and among the grapes you have a pathetic little raisin among the bunch that just doesn’t belong. I expected there to be more guys on a Computer Science course for sure, but the ratio of boys to girls is quite staggering.</p>
<p>What am I doing this evening? I don’t really know, I’ve already forgotten. Although as long as I have time to watch “I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!” with my roommate, Ayesha, it’s all good!</p>
