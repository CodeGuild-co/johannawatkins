<h1><u> Bletchley Park - 25/11/2015</h1></u>
<p>Today, I took a trip down memory lane and visited Bletchley Park.  I visited the place a year ago with school; there were 10 girls. This year, there were 4 girls and 21 dudes taking part in the same tour I had in 2014. This trip was a lot better than my previous visit, because of the level of detail the tour guides went in to.</p>
<p>When you’re in year 11, your technical knowledge isn’t at its optimum. You’re not quite at the level of study where you learn about fancy techy terms. Being a Villiers Park student, we’re supposed to be in the top 5% of students in the country. I would say this is true for 24 out of the 25 students here – as I said before, my grades are not the best. However when it comes to technology, I am completely in my element and it was a relief to be able to understand the majority of what the tour guides were talking about.</p>
<p>We learnt a lot that day: from the history of computers, to code breaking machines in the war, to coding in the language BASIC.<br/>
<p>BASIC is a fairly simple language that was created in 1964 by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz. Kids magazines used to contain pages of the code, in order to create your very own game at a fraction of the price. It saved money and taught a lot of new skills to children. We created a game of snake at Bletchley Park, and I don’t wish to admit how much fun I actually had programming it. </p>
<p>It is currently 22:16 and I’m catching up on last night’s episode of ‘I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here!’ as I type this. I may have to end the post now, as I feel like I’m falling asleep faster and faster with every character I type. Tomorrow is the last full day at Villiers; let’s hope it’s a good one!</p>
