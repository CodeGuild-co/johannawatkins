<h1><u>Software Engineering - 24/11/2015</h1></u>
<p>Being a Software Engineer is simple: it’s all about problem solving and being lazy. <br/>
In Software Engineering, one of the key skills is problem solving. It isn’t just about how you tackle the problem, but breaking down your problem into several factors. You need to consider the smaller decisions which together form your big issue. For example: </p>
<ul>
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
<li>What language are you going to program in?</li>
<li>What is your time scale?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are only a few of the deciding factors that contribute towards a successful solution. Oh, and don’t just complete a project yourself. Everyone in a team will have different problem solving skills, and will be suited to specific tasks than others would. Distribute your work between other group members to make your life a lot easier. The less work you can be doing yourself, the better.
<br/>That leads me onto the ‘being lazy’ part. Why bother to code a function from scratch by yourself, when there is already someone that has done it for you? Make the use of websites like ‘Stack Overflow’ that contain thousands of codes that software engineers have written. If it means you can be spending more time on a trickier section of code, it makes sense to use a pre-existing sample.</p>
<p>I guess there isn’t a message as such to this blog post, but to educate you about the skills of a Software Engineer (if you want to call it that…) ‘Being lazy’ is as great as it sounds, and the whole problem solving aspect is what makes the job so fun in the first place. With the right mentality and positive attitude, anyone has the ability to become a Software Engineer.</p>
